---
1. Move **Mouse** to move camera and change direction of character
2. Press **Spacebar** to make a small jump
3. Press and Hold **Spacebar** to charge your jump - the longer you hold *Spacebar* the Higher/Frather the character will jump
4. While in the air, use **A** and **D** to position the character's body
You can stick to any vertival surface and jump off of it, but only for a short while
